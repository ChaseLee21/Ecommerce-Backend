  ## Description
  This project uses node.js with express, mysql, dotenv, and sequelize to create a backend server for an ecommerce website. The project does not have a front end and to interact with the backend I use a program called insomnia to make REST http requests to the server. For a more indepth explaination of the program refer to the video demonstration link below.

  ## Installation
  refer to usage information or for a video demonstration refer to the video below.
  ## Usage
  To use the app you must have node.js and mysql installed on your system. For development I used node.js version 20. Clone the repository to your machine. Open a terminal inside the repository and run the command 'npm install' to install all dependencies. Then you must login to mysql through your terminal by running 'mysql -u root -p' and enter your password for mysql when prompt. Once logged in run 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' to create the database on your machine. Close mysql and open a new terminal. Run 'node seeds/index.js' to seed the database with data to get started. Once seeded you may start the program by running 'node server.js'
